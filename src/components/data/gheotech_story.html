  <p>After working a lot of years in the industry, I felt like I became mature enough to start Gheo Tech. I am not sure if this company will ever have more than one employee, as the point of Gheo Tech is to promote my skills and to create new business relationships. I am currently focusing my time on developing software for various customers and on building with time my own apps.</p>
  <p>As the geek within is still strong, I decided to focus myself on developing apps using the Rust programming language. The elegance, the security and the performance of the language are unprecedented, but this still does not make Rust ideal for most software businesses today. The main reason why other languages are experiencing faster adoption is because the industry today needs simple languages, and Rust has a special degree of complexity. Despite the steep learning curve, the market share of Rust is increasing fast, mostly due to the high quality of the language itself and the high quality of the software developed using Rust.</p>
  <p>Also, as I am still driven by my political and moral values, I am looking forward to working as much as possible with blockchain technologies. I truly believe that crypto can help us build a better world, despite the challenges that we have faced since its inception. Most of the software in this space is still not stable and regulations are required in order to bring the technology into mainstream. That being said, the chains that have already been developed are amazing. Projects like Solana, Polkadot/Substrate and Cosmos SDK are showing us what the future of finance will look like, and I want to be part of this future as I am fascinated by the technological progress that was already made.</p>
