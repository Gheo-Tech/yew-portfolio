  <p>The years at Vodafone Cloud were the first time in my life when I had a chance to use my talents, to shine and to actually enjoy life. These were good years. The payment was not much, but it was enough to live a healthy lifestyle and also get some cool technology. For the success I had during this time I will always be grateful to my mentor from that time, who in the meantime also became my friend. This was the first time in life when I really left like I got integrated into society and that I got the chance to help others with my skills and my knowledge.</p>
  <p>One of the biggest influences that this time had on my career was to see that the work that I perform as an engineer has a huge impact on a business. We sometimes think that the small guys are inconsequential, but seeing how my work can help and influence business worth 1000x more than my apartment gave me the confidence I required for all projects that I did after leaving Vodafone.</p>
  <p>It was this experience that convinced me that I should focus my career on open source technologies. Considering the huge impact that well-delivered projects can have on the industry, I decided to support as much as I can the technologies that I believe in. I was always convinced that open-source will help us build a better future for mankind and my experiences at Vodafone cemented within me the idea that I can influence the world by simply choosing to work with open-source technologies. The work-environment at Vodafone was not very supportive of open-source, but this motivated to push forward to create presentations showcasing how open-source can help push the company forward.</p>
  <p>As all good things come to an end... I moved to an even cooler place that I enjoyed even more.</p>
