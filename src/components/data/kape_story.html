  <p>The first two years at Kape were by far the most exciting years of my life. When I joined, the only VPN company under Kape was CyberGhost. The VPN infrastructure from CyberGhost was using legacy technologies and I got the green-light to modify it as I see fit, as long as I can make it faster, cheaper and easier to manage. I started working on the new solution and in the meantime, the company also acquired ZenMate VPN. A year and a half after joining the company, both CyberGhost and ZenMate were using my server solution to offer VPN services.</p>
  <p>At about the time when my new VPN server solution was ready and in prod, Kape acquired PIA. The PIA server solution at the time of acquisition had only legacy code. The next obvious step was to also migrate PIA to the new solution, which I did in 2020. That's the short story of how I ended up architecting, implementing, deploying and managing a private cloud solution for edge devices that supports delivery of VPN services for some of the biggest VPN companies in the world. One of the coolest parts about this story is that all companies were initially supporting only OpenVPN and IPsec. The new solution also supported WireGuard, which provided a huge performance boost for the VPN services and made a lot of users very happy.</p>
  <p>... and that's mostly where the fun parts started to end and I moved into other responsibilities that I did not enjoy so much. The first two years in the company were packed with technical responsibilities, research and development. After the solution was done and in production, I started to build teams capable of managing the system for the long-run. This meant for me that I had to accept more management and leadership responsibilities and with time I got less and less hands-on work.</p>
  <p>In the last year at Kape I started to focus my private time with research of blockchain technologies. It became clear to me that I was again chasing the feeling that I got during the first two years, when I had the opportunity to research modern technologies and create a monster project that can actually shape a company. Up to this point, my years at Kape were by far the most enjoyable years of my life and I currently feel pke the experiences gained there will continue to influence my entire career.</p>
  <p>It became obvious that I needed another big challenge, and as the company grew even more with the acquisition of ExpressVPN, I figured I should be on my way in the search of new exciting projects.</p>
