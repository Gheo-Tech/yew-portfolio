  <p>Before going into this story, I want to let you know that I have huge respect for people working at IBM and for IBM as a company. There are a lot of fun projects in IBM, just not the projects I landed on. At the time, IBM was getting a lot of outsourcing contracts for projects that nobody else had the capacity to maintain.</p>
  <p>Now let's get into it. The short version of the story is that I really didn't want to be there. When you are young you have this idea that it's a huge honour to work for a big corporation, till you actually get there and the reapty doesn't really meet the expectation. The freelance I did in the university didn't really cover all my expenses and I obviously did not have the required experience to start my own company, so leveraging German and my coding skills to land a corporate job seemed a no-brainer. The recruiter also hyped the job a bit and I also had a good time at the interview.</p>
  <p>After joining, I get my laptop and I get informed that Windows is mandatory for the project. Sadly at the time I was not experienced enough to ask "Can I work on Linux on this project?". After getting the laptop, I was informed that my first task is to set up my IDE and my local server and that this will take 1 month. I thought they were joking, but it pterally took one month to set up the work environment. I understand that some people have a great time working on Java projects. I will assume I am not tailored for this particular taste and that proper automation can make even Java be a fun programming language. I was not feepng engaged in my day-job and I was still having more fun with my personal projects, so I asked my people manager if any Linux project within IBM was available for me.</p>
  <p>So... I got switched to a Linux project. A RHEL 4 Linux project, built on servers that didn't get any upgrades in over 10 years. This experience was great for my career, as it helped me understand how bad projects can fail if they are left unmaintained.</p>
  <p>As you probably figured, I left.</p>
