Portfolio website template written using Yew (Rust FrontEnd template). I don't hate JavaScript, I just avoid it like fire.

In case you are a Rust developer and you would like to create your portfolio website using something other than JavaScript/TypeScript/VueJS/React, you are in the right place. Please feel free to fork this project!
